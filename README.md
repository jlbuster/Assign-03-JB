# Assign-03-JB
Carleton Coding Bootcamp, Third Assignment

 - Application that uses html, css, but mainly js that randomly generates a password depending on how the user answers various prompts.
 - Application will generate this random password when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button.
 - Password is generated with lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
 - This website uses a while loop(js) to execute the majority of the generatePassword function(also js) which reduces the amount of code written while maintaining good legibility and efficiency.
 - See Issues tab for screenshots
